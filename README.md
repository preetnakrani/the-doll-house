# Milestone 1
Here is a summary of what to expect with our milestone 1 implementation:

**Wall collisions**
Collision resolution was accomplished by stopping the player's motion when they hit the attic wall, or try to walk off screen.

**Battle screen**
When you collide with a dust bunny, you will enter battle mode. Currently, the battle feedback is provided in the console.
So please look there for the relevant print statements.
You will want to click the "punch" attack until the enemy's HP reaches 0 (the enemy's HP is printed to the console).
